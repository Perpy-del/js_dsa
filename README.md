# JavaScript Data Structure and Algorithms Examples

## Queuing System

An online food ordering system uses a queue to manage incoming orders. Implement a queue data structure to represent this order queue. 
- Explain how to add new orders to the queue.
- Simulate processing orders by removing them from the front of the queue.
- Discuss the efficiency of using a queue for this purpose.

## Sort Restaurants 

Create a JavaScript function named recommendRestaurants that takes an array of restaurant objects as input. Each object should have the following properties:

    - name: The name of the restaurant (string)
    - rating: The average customer rating of the restaurant (number)

The function should perform two functionalities:

    - Sort the restaurants in descending order based on their rating values.
    - Finding Restaurants by Rating: Given an optional targetRating (number) passed as a second argument, return a new array containing only restaurants with a rating higher than or equal to the targetRating. You can use an appropriate searching algorithm (e.g., built-in filter methods).

## Insert Node into a Sorted List

Given a sorted linked list, insert a new node with a given value into the correct sorted position in the list.Example
    Input: head = [1, 2, 4, 5], value = 3
    Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

## Reverse Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the new head.Example
    Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
